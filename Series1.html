							<p align="justify">On the planet Ixiter you have just been employed as an assistant to Dr. Meridus Alberto Proctor, the world's leading scientist in nanogenetic mutation. The spreading of a new virus, one of alien origin, has proven itself unstoppable and as a last ditch method the royal family of Ixiter has charged Dr. Meridus with the task of creating a weapon against it. Many thought the task impossible, but the man himself had proven himself once more, creating a serum (entitled Project Morph) that not only combated the deadly virus but managed to altercate the very genetic code of the subject using the serum. As an assistant, your mission is to help finish testing the serum, perfecting it's design and showcasing the weapon that will save humanity. This is 2D Metroidvania style game allows the protagonist to morph into the alien creatures it encounters and use their abilities to further explore the areas around them. Explore the many natural creatures of the planet within the safety of a simulated test room and showcase the true potential of the Project Morph Serum. In this one player campaign, explore 5 locations each with their own unique features, a variety of interesting creatures and a fantastic soundtrack.</p>

							  <div></div>
						  </div>
							<div>
							  <h3>DR. MERIDUS ALBERTO PROCTOR</h3>
							  <div></div>
						  </div>
							<p align="justify">Meet your employer. He has light grey hair and brown eyes, a long yet harsh face. He is usually seen wearing a silver jumpsuit under his white lab coat. This man also wears glasses, although he says it's purely for aesthetic reasons and that he doesn't really need them. With a lean build and hardly any muscle on the body most would say he's quite weak, but everything about the way the man moves and talks screams military efficiency. He can be quite rude at time, is quick to point out flaws in other peoples work or logic (the primary reason he has no assistants). Loves making jokes all the time or commenting on a bad situation. Will always make his own accomplishments look great even if they were minor.</p>
							<div>
							  <h3>ARC - ASSISTANT ROBOT COMPUTER</h3>
							  <div></div>
						  </div>
							<p align="justify">As the name suggests, ARC is the OS that Dr. Meridus himself development to help his research. This robot's task is to help the subject complete all their missions with ease, however its opinions on its master have somewhat shown themselves as of late. ARC is hardly a timid character, but is wary of anybody new. It sees itself as a superior tool compared to the other machines in its masters lab and will not let you forget about that.</p>
							<div>
							  <h3>SCR-7000</h3>
							  <div></div>
						  </div>
							<p align="justify">This character is a military bot, ordered to protect its assignment. Although he doesn't speak much this machine has accomplished many impressive feats, part of a special division that is currently working to combat the new threat that is slowly changing their home planet. Since he was designed for military purposes the SCR- 7000 is quite bold in the way he speaks, his vocabulary is designed to give quick and simple instructions. He takes pride in his work but more often than not he'll remind you that he can't wait to get back into more "adventurous" work again.</p>

								<p><center>"They gave us a 150 year old mission?"</center></p>
								<p align="justify">As a member of the Deep Planetary Research Team you have been tasked with gathering information about a planet that was known to have borne advanced life. It had sent a distress message over 150 years ago but due to a war that threatened the very balance of the Galactic Federation all efforts of relief were stopped. 150 years later the forgotten case had been reopened and you immediately set off to investigate but upon reaching the upper atmosphere of the planet an unknown force causes your ships instruments to stop working and you crash land in a remote part of the planet. Now it's up to you and the other members of your team to uncover the mystery behind this planet and escape. The game will feature a multitude of game modes, areas to explore, transformations to find and bosses to battle. The world that the player finds themselves in will constantly adapt to the player, throwing tougher and harder creatures at the protagonist in an attempt to stop them.</p>
